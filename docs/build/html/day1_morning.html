<p>During workshop, we will transfer different output files from flux to your local system. Cyberduck makes it easier to drag and drop any remote file onto your local system and vice versa. Of course, you can use &#8220;scp&#8221; to transfer files but Cyberduck provides a graphical interface to manage file transfer and helps avoid typing long file paths and commands.</p>

<!-- **Set up your .bashrc file so your environment is all set for genomic analysis!** --><p><strong>Setting up environment variables in .bashrc file so your environment is all set for genomic analysis!</strong></p>
<p>Environment variables are the variables/values that describe the environment in which programs run in. All the programs and scripts on your unix system use these variables for extracting information such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What is my current working directory?,</li>
<li>Where are temporary files stored?,</li>
<li>Where are perl/python libraries?,</li>
<li>Where is Blast installed? etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to environment variables that are set up by system administators, each user can set their own environment variables to customize their experience. This may sound like something super advanced that isn&#8217;t relevant to beginners, but that&#8217;s not true!</p>
<p>Some examples of ways that we will use environment variables in the class are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>create shortcuts for directories that you frequently go to,</li>
<li>tell unix where frequently used programs live, so you don&#8217;t have to put the full path name each time you use it and</li>
<li>setup a shortcut for getting on a cluster node, so that you don&#8217;t have to write out the full command each time.</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to set your environment variables would be to manually set up these variables everytime you log in, but this would be extremely tedious and inefficient. So, Unix has setup a way around this, which is to put your environment variable assignments in special files called .bashrc or .bash_profile. Every user has one or both of these files in their home directory, and what&#8217;s special about them is that the commands in them are executed every time you login. So, if you simply set your environmental variable assignments in one of these files, your environment will be setup just the way you want it each time you login!</p>
<p>All the softwares/tools that we need in this workshop are installed in a directory &#8220;/scratch/micro612w18_fluxod/shared/bin/&#8221; and we want the shell to look for these installed tools in this directory. For this, We will save the full path to these tools in an environment variable PATH.</p>

<p>Up until now youâve probably accessed sequence data from NCBI by going to the website, laboriously clicking around and finally finding and downloading the data you want.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons that is not ideal:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Itâs frustrating and slow to deal with the web interface</li>
<li>It can be hard to keep track of where the data came from and exactly which version of a sequence you downloaded</li>
<li>Its not conducive to downloading lots of sequence data</li>
</ul>
<p>To download sequence data in Unix you can use a variety of commands (e.g. sftp, wget, curl). Here, we will use the curl command to download some genome assemblies from NCBI ftp location:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Go to your class home directory (use your wd shortcut!)</li>
<li>Execute the following commands to copy files for this morningâs exercises to your home directory:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
cp -r /scratch/micro612w18_fluxod/shared/data/day1_morn/ ./

<p>These files are genome assemblies in fasta format. Fasta files are a common sequence data format that is composed of alternating sequence headers (sequence names and comments) and their corresponding sequences. Of great importance, the sequence header lines must start with â&gt;â. These genome assemblies have one header line for each contig in the assembly, and our goal will be to count the number of contigs/sequences. To do this we will string together two Unix commands: âgrepâ and âwcâ. âgrepâ (stands for global regular expression print), is an extremely powerful pattern matching command, which we will use to identify all the lines that start with a â&gt;â. âwcâ (stand for word count) is a command for counting words, characters and lines in a file. To count the number of contigs in one of your fasta files enter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
grep &quot;&gt;&quot; E_coli.fna | wc -l
</pre>
<p>Try this command on other assemblies to see how many contigs they have</p>

<p>OK, so now that we have a useful command, wouldnât it be great to turn it into a program that you can easily apply to a large number of genome assemblies? Of course it would! So, now we are going to take out cool contig counting command, and put it in a shell script that applies it to all files in the desired directory.</p>

The following task will brush up some basic R plotting commands and help you visualize some complex omics data for interpretation.</p>
<p>One of the most common types of genomic analysis involves comparing the newly sequenced read data of an organism to your choice of reference organism genome. Mapping millions of reads generated in a sequencing experiment to the reference genome fasta file and interpreting various parameters can achieve this analysis.
One such parameter is validating how well your sequencing experiment performed and assessing the âuniformityâ of coverage from whole-genome sequencing.&nbsp;Visualizing Sequencing coverage across the reference genome help us answer this question. Sequencing coverage describes the average number of reads that align to, or &#8220;cover,&#8221; known reference bases.</p>
<p>The input for this task is a comma-separated file, which contains average sequencing coverage information i.e average number of reads mapped to each 1000 base pairs in reference genome. You can find this input file in your day1_morn directory by the name, Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv</p>
<!---
Letâs copy Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv file from flux shared directory to your desktop using âscpâ. âscpâ stands for secure copy and is used for securely transferring files between remote host/server(flux) and your local computer system. (Both directions)
scp username@flux-xfer.arc-ts.umich.edu:/scratch/micro612w18_fluxod/shared/Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv ~/Desktop/
Note: You can use your choice of folder/path to copy the file instead of  â~/Desktop/â
--><p>Drag and drop this Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv to your local system using cyberduck.</p>
<p>Now, Fire up R console or studio and import the file (Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv) using any type of data import functions in R (read.table, read.csv etc.)</p>
<p>Hint: The file is comma-separated and contains header line (âbin,Average_coverageâ) so use appropriate parameters while importing the file</p>
<p>Once the data in file is imported into R object, you can plot the column Average_coverage as a time series plot to assess the coverage of your mapped reads across genome.</p>
<p>Note: A&nbsp;time series plot&nbsp;is a graph that you can use to evaluate patterns and behavior in data over&nbsp;time. Here, we can employ the same plot to see the pattern i.e read depth/coverage at each 1000 bases (represented by bins columns where each bin represents Average number of reads mapped to each 1000 bases in reference genome) using the simplest R function for time series such as <a class="reference external" href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/plot.ts.html">plot.ts</a></p>
<p>An example plot.ts plot for Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv is shown below for your reference.</p>
<p><img alt="alt tag" src="_images/plot_1.png" /></p>
<p>For advance and more beautiful visualization, ggplot2 can be employed to display the same plot. An example ggplot2 plot for Ecoli_coverage_average_bed.csv is shown below for your reference.</p>

<p>In software carpentry, you learned working with shell and automating simple tasks using basic unix commands. Lets see how some of these commands can be employed in genomics analysis while exploring various file formats that we use in day to day analysis. For this session, we will try to explore three different types of bioinformatics file formats:</p>
<p>fasta: used for representing either nucleotide or peptide sequences</p>
<p>gff: used for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences</p>
<p>fastq: used for storing biological sequence / sequencing reads (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Question: Previously, you downloaded genome assembly fasta files and ran a shell script to count contigs. Now, lets say you want to find out the combined length of genome in each of these files. This can be achieved by running a short unix command piping together two unix programs: grep and wc. The key to crafting the command is understanding the  features of fasta files,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><strong><em>1) each sequence in fasta file is preceded by a fasta header that starts with &#8220;&gt;&#8221;,</em></strong></div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><strong><em>2) the types of bases that a nucleotide sequence represents (A,T,G,C,N)</em></strong></div></blockquote>
<p>To determine the total length of our genome assemblies, we will use grep to match only those lines that doesn&#8217;t start with &#8220;&gt;&#8221; (remember grep -v option is used to ignore lines) and doesn&#8217;t contain character &#8220;N&#8221;. Then use wc command (stands for word count) to count the characters. We can use unix pipe &#8220;|&#8221; to pass the output of one command to another for further processing. Lets start by counting the number of bases in Acinetobacter_baumannii.fna file</p>

grep -v '^&gt;' Acinetobacter_baumannii.fna | grep -v &quot;N&quot; | grep -v &quot;n&quot; | wc -m

#Note:

#- The sign &quot;^&quot; inside the grep pattern represents any pattern that starts with &quot;&gt;&quot; and -v asks grep to ignore those lines.
#- Use &quot;|&quot; to pass the output of one command to another.
#- -m parameter will show the character counts. Check wc help menu by typing &quot;wc --help&quot; on terminal to explore other parameters

<li>Exploring GFF files</li>
</ul>
<p>The GFF (General Feature Format) format is a tab-seperated file and consists of one line per feature, each containing 9 columns of data.</p>
<p>column 1: seqname - name of the genome or contig or scaffold</p>
<p>column 2: source - name of the program that generated this feature, or the data source (database or project name)</p>
<p>column 3: feature - feature type name, e.g. Gene, exon, CDS, rRNA, tRNA, CRISPR, etc.</p>
<p>column 4: start - Start position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.</p>
<p>column 5: end - End position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.</p>
<p>column 6: score - A floating point value.</p>
<p>column 7: strand - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).</p>
<p>column 8: frame - One of &#8216;0&#8217;, &#8216;1&#8217; or &#8216;2&#8217;. &#8216;0&#8217; indicates that the first base of the feature is the first base of a codon, &#8216;1&#8217; that the second base is the first base of a codon, and so on..</p>

<p>Some more useful one-line unix commands for GFF files: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/stephenturner/oneliners#gff3-annotations">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Unix one-liners</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you receive your sample data from sequencing centre, the first thing you do is check its quality using a quality control tool such as FastQC and make sure that it contain sequences from organism that you are working on (Free from any contamination). But before carrying out extensive QC, you can run a bash &#8220;one-liner&#8221; to get some basic statistics about the raw reads. These one-liners are great examples for how a set of simple (relatively) Unix commands can be piped together to do really useful things.</p>
<p>Run the following command to print total number of reads in each file, total number of unique reads, percentage of unique reads, most abundant sequence(useful to find adapter sequences or contamination), its frequency, and frequency of that sequence as a proportion of the total reads, average read length.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for i in Rush_KPC_266_*.gz; do zcat $i | awk 'BEGIN{OFS=&quot;\t&quot;};((NR-2)%4==0){read=$1;total++;count[read]++;len+=length(read)}END{for(read in count){if(!max||count[read]&gt;max) {max=count[read];maxRead=read};if(count[read]==1){unique++}};print total,unique,unique*100/total,maxRead,count[maxRead],count[maxRead]*100/total,len/total}'; done

#The above awk command reads every fourth record and calculates some basic fastq statistics.
</pre>
<p>Now try running the above command using fastq_screen.fastq.gz as input.</p>
<p>You can find more of such super useful bash one-liners at Stephen Turner&#8217;s github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/stephenturner/oneliners">page</a>. You can also use some pre-written unix utilities and tools such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">seqtk</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lh3/bioawk">bioawk</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">fastx</a> which comes in handy while extracting complex information from fasta/fastq/sam/bam files and are optimized to be insanely fast.</p>

<p>When running a sequencing pipeline, it is very important to make sure that your data matches appropriate quality threshold and are free from any contaminants. This step will help you make correct interpretations in downstream analysis and will also let you know if you are required to redo the experiment/library preparation or resequencing or remove contaminant sequences.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we will employ fastq screen to screen one of our sample against a range of reference genome databases.</p>
<p>In the previous section, did you notice the sample fastq_screen.fastq.gz had only 28 % unique reads? What sequences does it contain?</p>
<p>To answer this, We will screen it against Human, Mouse and Ecoli genome and try to determine what percentage of reads are contaminant such as host DNA, i.e Human and mouse.</p>
<p>We have already created the human, mouse and ecoli reference databases inside fastq_screen tool directory which you can take a look by running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

ls /scratch/micro612w18_fluxod/shared/bin/fastq_screen_v0.5.2/data/

<p>Note: You will learn creating reference databases in our afternoon session.</p>

<p>The above run will generate two types of output file: a screen report in text format &#8220;fastq_screen_screen.txt&#8221; and a graphical output &#8220;fastq_screen_screen.png&#8221; showing percentage of reads mapped to each reference genomes.</p>

<p>Now we will run FastQC on some sample raw data to assess its quality. FastQC is a quality control tool that reads in sequence data in a variety of formats(fastq, bam, sam) and can either provide an interactive application to review the results or create an HTML based report which can be integrated into any pipeline. It is generally the first step that you take upon receiving the sequence data from sequencing facility to get a quick sense of its quality and whether it exhibits any unusual properties (e.g. contamination or unexpected biological features)</p>

<p>The analysis in FastQC is broken down into a series of analysis modules.

<p>Lets first look at the quality drop(per base sequence quality graph) at the end of &#8220;Per Base Sequence Quality&#8221; graph. This degredation of quality towards the end of reads is commonly observed in illumina samples. The reason for this drop is that as the number of sequencing cycles performed increases, the average quality of the base calls, as reported by the Phred Scores produced by the sequencer falls.</p>
<p>Next, lets check the overrepresented sequences graph and the kind of adapters that were used for sequencing these samples (Truseq or Nextera) which comes in handy while indicating the adapter database path during downstream filtering step (Trimmomatic).</p>

<p>Filtering out problematic sequences within a dataset is inherently a trade off between sensitivity (ensuring all contaminant sequences are removed) and specificity (leaving all non-contaminant sequence data intact). Adapter and other technical contaminants can potentially occur in any location within the reads.(start, end, read-through (between the reads), partial adapter sequences)</p>
<p>Trimmomatic is a tool that tries to search these potential contaminant/adapter sequence within the read at all the possible locations. It takes advantage of the added evidence available in paired-end dataset. In paired-end data, read-through/adapters can occur on both the forward and reverse reads of a particular fragment in the same position. Since the fragment was entirely sequenced from both ends, the non-adapter portion of the forward and reverse reads will be reverse-complements of each other. This strategy of searching for contaminant in both the reads is called &#8216;palindrome&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>For more information on how Trimmomatic tries to achieve this, Please refer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf">this</a> manual.</p>

<p>First, Trimmomatic searches for any matches between the reads and adapter sequences. Adapter sequences are stored in this directory of Trimmomatic tool: /scratch/micro612w18_fluxod/shared/bin/Trimmomatic/adapters/. Trimmomatic comes with a list of standard adapter fasta sequences such TruSeq, Nextera etc. You should use appropriate adapter fasta sequence file based on the illumina kit that was used for sequencing. You can get this information from your sequencing centre or can find it in FastQC html report (Section: Overrepresented sequences).</p>
<p>Short sections (2 bp as determined by seed misMatch parameter) of each adapter sequences (contained in TruSeq3-PE.fa) are tested in each possible position within the reads. If it finds a perfect match, It starts searching the entire adapter sequence and scores the alignment. The advantage here is that the full alignment is calculated only when there is a perfect seed match which results in considerable efficiency gains. So, When it finds a match, it moves forward with full alignment and when the match reaches 10 bp determined by simpleClipThreshold, it finally trims off the adapter from reads.</p>
<p>Quoting Trimmomatic:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Palindrome&#8217; trimming is specifically designed for the case of &#8216;reading through&#8217; a short fragment into the adapter sequence on the other end. In this approach, the appropriate adapter sequences are &#8216;in silico ligated&#8217; onto the start of the reads, and the combined adapter+read sequences, forward and reverse are aligned. If they align in a manner which indicates &#8216;read- through&#8217; i.e atleast 30 bp match, the forward read is clipped and the reverse read dropped (since it contains no new data).&#8221;</p>

<p>After running Trimmomatic, you should notice that the sequence quality improved (Per base sequence quality) and now it doesn&#8217;t contain any contaminants/adapters (Overrepresented sequences).</p>
<p>Next, take a look at the per base sequence content graph, and notice that the head bases(~9 bp) are slightly imbalanced. In a perfect scenario, each nucleotide content should run parallel to each other, and should be reflective of the overall A/C/T/G content of your input sequence.</p>
<p>Quoting FastQC:
&#8220;It&#8217;s worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead provides enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5&#8217; end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn&#8217;t something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn&#8217;t seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will however produce a warning or error in this module.&#8221;</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look very bad but you can remove the red cross sign by trimming these imbalanced head bases using HEADCROP:9 flag in the above command.</p>
